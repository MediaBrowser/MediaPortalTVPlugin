Outstandings Tasks

 - Investigate the hour offset issue in the guide
 - Check the authentication exception calling services with invalid credentials
 - Add configuration for the channel / TV images size
 
 - Test check calling to streaming service
 - Test configuration Combo for streaming profiles to configuration page
 - Test configuration for the position to take the recording image from.
 - Test channel logo fix
 - Test Live TV and Recording Streaming
 - Test Round UP the pre / post padding seconds - minute conversion

Unsupported:

 - Picking individual days for a series schedule (if more than one day is specifed and it is not Monday - Friday or Saturday - Sunday, we opt for recording everyday)
 - Recording Only New Programs
 - Setting the "Is" properties on the programs (IsMovie etc)

Suggestions to MB:

 - Live TV appears in the client when the Plugin reports it is "Unavailable"

 - MPExtended doesn't provide update methods for schedules (series / timers), so when "updating", we have to 
   delete the existing schedule and create a new one. This gives the schedule a new Id. So when the edit
   page stays in edit mode and a second update is made, it fails on saving as the "old" Id is being used.
   This would be resolved by returning to the list page when a schedule is updated. When you create a new schedule
   (from the guide, then clicking save) you are taken to the list page, so a modied behaviour would be more consistent
   with that.

 - Allow an implementation to define it's capabilities. A suggestion would be to have on ILiveTvService
	
	public LiveTVCapability Capabilities { get; }

	The LiveTVCapability enum would be [Flags] with values like:
		- CanScheduleDays = 1
		- CanScheduleWorkDays = 2
		- CanScheduleWeekendDays = 4
		- CanDeleteRecordings = 8
		- CanDeleteSeries = 16
		.....
		
 - Add a "Now", "NextDay", "PreviousDay" to the schedule grid

 - Add a resume to playing recordings, passing in the postition tp the recording streaming.

 Questions:

  - How can I pass a list of values to the configuration html screen to populate a combo box
  - MB doesn't provide guide programme images out of the box - is there a TVDB provider that I can use to get images for tv programmes, or perhaps the main program can search based on the programme title when one isn't supplied?
