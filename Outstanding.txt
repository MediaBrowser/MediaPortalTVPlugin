Outstandings Tasks

 - Add streaming for direct first
 - Add Combo for streaming profiles to configuration page
 - Add TV Recording Images (requires streaming or a change to MPExtended)
 - Round UP the pre / post padding seconds - minute conversion
 - Parameterise the channel / TV images size

Unsupported:
 - Delete recording when using MPExtended < 0.6
 - Picking individual days for a series schedule (if more than one day is specifed and it is not Monday - Firday or Saturday - Sunday, we opt for recording everyday)
 - Record Only New Programs
 - Setting the "Is" properties on the programs (IsMovie etc)

Suggestions to MB:

 - Live TV appears in the client when the Plugin reports it is "Unavailable"

 - MPExtended doesn't provide update methods for schedules (series / timers), so when "updating", we have to 
   delete the existing schedule and create a new one. This gives the schedule a new Id. So when the edit
   page stays in edit mode and a second update is made, it fails on saving as the "old" Id is being used.
   This would be resolved by returning to the list page when a schedule is updated. When you create a new schedule
   (from the guide, then clicking save) you are taken to the list page, so a modied behaviour would be more consistent
   with that.

 - Allow an implementation to define it's capabilities. A suggestion would be to have on ILiveTvService
	
	public LiveTVCapability Capabilities { get; }

	The LiveTVCapability enum would be [Flags] with values like:
		- CanScheduleDays = 1
		- CanScheduleWorkDays = 2
		- CanScheduleWeekendDays = 4
		- CanDeleteRecordings = 8
		- CanDeleteSeries = 16
		.....
		
 - Add a "Now", "NextDay", "PreviousDay" to the schedule grid

 Questions:

  - How can I pass a list of values to the configuration html screen to populate a combo box
